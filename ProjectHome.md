The Integrated Commerce System (ICS) with Googleâ€™s AdWards API

The Integrated Commerce System (ICS) is composed of three core modules, which include the Automated Commerce System (ACS), the Inventory Management System (IMS), and the Support Service System (SSS). ICS as a whole integrates all of these systems to create a collective and independent e-commerce system. Integration of the system occurs when one module of the subsystem requests information from another module. The database of the system is the key ingredient to integrating the entire system, primarily as a data-sharing agent. The following are descriptions of the sub-systems that make up the composition of ICS:

Automated Commerce System (ACS)

The ACS is an electronic shopping center and store. It handles all business transactions made between clients/customers and the ICS.

It is used to display inventory to clients/customers and functions as an electronic store shelf to display products and services.

It is used to process orders and track the status of completed orders.

It is used to manage financial information (payments, sales, transactions, etc).

Inventory Management System (IMS)

The IMS is an electronic stocking center. It manages all products and services available for sale, as well as customer information (name, address, payment info, etc). This system is used to manage current merchandise/services, input new, delete obsolete and update quantities available.

Support Service System (SSS)

The SSS is an electronic customer service representative that helps to solve specific problems to minimize the need for human interaction with clients/customers. The SSS handles all support interaction between clients/customers and the ICS. This includes order/invoice automated e-mails, CSR (customer service representative) response interface, and Help/FAQ interactive directory.
